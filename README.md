# ToDo-Fullstack-App
I recently completed amazons full stack web development course. This is a project showcasing the skills I learned. This full stack app uses SpringBoot, Thymeleaf, java and other important tools. I developed each page by myself, chose the styling and interactivity.

This app is a basic to do list. Users can create, view and manage their tasks. 
Tasks are also automatically organised by priority and completion date.

To run this app:
Download the files and run ToDoRailsApplication.java
Then proceed to http://localhost:8080/dashboard

You can then register a new account and access the app.

The concept of this app is not that advanced. It was just a personal project to test my knowledge on front end and backend development. The front end uses thymeleaf and the backend uses springboot. Obviously, my html,css,javascript,java and api knowledge was put to the test as well!
