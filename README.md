# ToDo-Fullstack-App
I recently completed amazons full stack web development course. This is a project showcasing the skills I learned. This full stack app uses SpringBoot, Thymeleaf, java and other important tools. I developed each page by myself, chose the styling and interactivity.

This app is a basic to do list. Users can create, view and manage their tasks. 
Tasks are also automatically organised by priority and completion date.

To run this app:
Download the files and run ToDoRailsApplication.java
Then proceed to http://localhost:8080/dashboard

You can then register a new account and access the app.
